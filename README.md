# Backend-Oop-Intro

This repo contain 7 exercises that i used to get more familiar with the *Oop*.

## The objectives

Let's see what i've done here.

Exercise 1 and 2

- Create a class
- Create properties
- Use a default value in the construct
- Make a function
- Instantiate an object
- Print the default value
- Make an extends of the previous class
- Create new properties for that extend class
- Foresee a construct that allows me to use all the properties of the first class

Exercise 3

- Discover the difference between public, protected and private for the properties
- Create a new private method in the first class that returns some info about an object
- Print those informations correctly

Exercise 4

- Make all properties protected
- Make all the other prints work without error and without changing the first class
- Avoid using getters and setters in the child class to see the difference

Exercise 5 and 6

- Change the properties to private
- Fix the errors without using getter and setter functions
- Make a constant
- Print it
- Create a function using that constant
- Print the output of that function
- Make sure that every print is on a new line

Exercise 7

- Make a static property that can be only accessed from the inside
- Print this property without creating a new instant of the first class
